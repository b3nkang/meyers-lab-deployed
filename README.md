FOR DEVS - BECAUSE NEXT.JS NESTED THE PAGE INSIDE THE REPO, make sure to cd into meyers-lab when cloning or opening the repo

In this site, we are planning to to build a research page and online index for the coding intensity report card website, which seeks to evaluate and highlight  patient diagnosis "scores" for private insurance companies under Medicare. Our website will contain the following pages:

## Pages
1. Home page - Basic information about the lab and their mission
2. Methods page – Lists different methods and processes to arrive at conclusions/scores for insurance companies and their practices--> requires the ability to be updated with new pdf forms
3. Data visualization page — Tableau / Google sheets
4. Download data page — make the data downloadable after filling form & captcha
5. About page – collaborators on the project --> name, blurb, image


## Goals: 
1. Create a page where anyone can download the report card from the website if they want to 
use the data themselves.
2. Ideally, an integration with something like tableau (visual map) or some sort of visualization to display the report card stastistics--> pie charts, etc
3. The third thing we need is just a page where we can post our research methods
