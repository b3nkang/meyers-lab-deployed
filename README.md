In this lab...

## Pages
1. Home Page
2. Research Overview
3. Report Card download (with form)
4. Tableau

## Goals: 
1. Create a page where anyone can download the report card from the website if they want to 
use the data themselves.
2. Ideally, an integration with something like tableau (visual map) to display the report card, so 
someone can view and sort the data without having to download it.
3. The third thing we need is just a page where we can post our research methods
