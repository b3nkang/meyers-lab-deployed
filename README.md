Goals: 
1. We need to have a place where anyone can download the report card from the website if they want to 
use the data themselves.
2. Ideally, we would also have an integration with something like tableau to display the report card, so 
someone can view and sort the data without having to download it.
3. The third thing we need is just a page where we can post our research methods
